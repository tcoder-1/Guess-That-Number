Description:-
  Guess That Number is a simple number-guessing game written in C++. The program generates a random number within a predefined 
  range, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback on 
  whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Features:-
  - Generates a random number using rand() and srand() for unpredictability.
  - Accepts user input and provides hints (Too High, Too Low).
  - Limits the number of attempts (MAX_ATTEMPTS = 8).
  - Allows replaying the game until the user decides to quit.
